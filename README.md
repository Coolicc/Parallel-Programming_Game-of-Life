# Parallel Programming: Game of Life

A student project I made for the High-Performance Computing course at Faculty of Science, University of Novi Sad. It consists of a non-parallel and parallel simulators of Conway's Game of Life, with some example starting field configurations. It is written in C using MPI for parallelization.
